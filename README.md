## Features

- **TCP Port Scanning**: Checks the status of TCP ports within a specified range.
- **UDP Port Scanning**: Checks the status of UDP ports within a specified range.
- **Logging**: Results are logged to a file for later review.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `prompt_toolkit` library (for interactive CLI)
